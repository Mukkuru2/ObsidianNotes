## Features

---

### Class

- **Divine Sense**
    
    As an action, you can detect good and evil. Until the end of your next turn, you can sense anything affected by the hallow spell or know the location of any celestial, fiend, undead within 60 ft. that is not behind total cover. You can use this feature **3** times per long rest.
    
- **Lay on Hands**
    
    You have a pool of healing power that can restore **20** HP per long rest. As an action, you can touch a creature to restore any number of HP remaining in the pool, or 5 HP to either cure a disease or neutralize a poison affecting the creature.
    
- **Fighting Style**
    
    You adopt a style of fighting as your specialty.
    
    **Defense**
    
    While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.
    
- **Spellcasting**
    
    You can cast prepared paladin spells using CHA as your spellcasting modifier (Spell DC **12**, Spell Attack **+4**). You can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus.
    
- **Divine Smite**
    
    When you hit with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one spell slot to deal 2d8 extra radiant damage to the target plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st (max 5d8) and plus 1d8 against undead or fiends (max 6d8 total).
    
- **Extra Attack**
    
    Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the **[Attack](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Attack)** action on your turn.
    

### Oath

- **Channel Divinity**
    
    Your oath allows you to channel divine energy to fuel magical effects. Each Channel Divinity option provided by your oath explains how to use it.
    
    When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which option to use. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.
    
    Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your paladin spell save DC.
    

### Feats

- **Extra Fighting Style**
    
    **Two-Weapon Fighting**
    
    *When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.*
    

### Racial

- **Darkvision**
    
    You can see in darkness (shades of gray) up to 60 ft.
    
- **Menacing**
    
    You gain proficiency in the Intimidation skill.
    
- **Relentless Endurance**
    
    When you are reduced to 0 HP but not killed, you can drop to 1 HP instead once per long rest.
    
- **Savage Attacks**
    
    When you score a critical hit, roll one of the dice an additional time and add it to the extra damage.
    

### Background

- **Rustic Hospitality**
    
    Since you come from the ranks of the common folk, you fit in among them with ease. You can find a place to hide, rest, or recuperate among other commoners, unless you have shown yourself to be a danger to them. They will shield you from the law or anyone else searching for you, though they will not risk their lives for you.
