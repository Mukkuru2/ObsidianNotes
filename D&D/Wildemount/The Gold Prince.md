### Racial

- **Breath Weapon** 
	When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace one of the attacks with an exhalation of destructive magical energy in a 15 ft. cone. Every creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw, the DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Con modifier. On a failed save a creature takes 1d10 damage of the type associated with your Metallic Ancestry or half as much damage on successful save. The damage increases to 2d10 at 5th level, 3d10 at 11th level, and 4d10 at 17th level. You can use this ability a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus per long rest.

- **Draconic Resistance** 
	Fire Resistance

- **Metallic Breath Weapon** 
	At 5th level, you gain a second breath weapon you can use in the place of a single attack when you take the Attack action. This breath is exhaled in a 15 ft. cone, with the DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Con modifier. When you use this ability choose one of the following options:
	- **Enervating Breath –** Each creature within the cone must succeed on Con saving throw or become incapacitated until the start of your next turn.
	- **Repulsion Breath –** Each creature within the cone must succeed on a Str saving throw or be pushed 20ft away from you and knocked prone.
	You can only use your Metallic Breath Weapon once per long rest.
