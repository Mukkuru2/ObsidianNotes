### Class

- **Eldritch Invocations**
	- **Agonizing Blast: Toll Dead**. 
	  Choose one of your known Warlock cantrips that deals damage. You can add your Charisma modifier to that spell’s damage rolls.
	- **Pact of the Chain**. 
	  You learn the [Find Familiar](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618877-find-familiar) spell and can cast it as a Magic action without expending a spell slot.
	  When you cast the spell, you choose one of the normal forms for your familiar or one of the following special forms: [Imp](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/4775825-imp), [Pseudodragon](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/4775834-pseudodragon), [Quasit](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/4775835-quasit), [Skeleton](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/4775841-skeleton), [Slaad Tadpole](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/4775842-slaad-tadpole), [Sphinx of Wonder](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/4775843-sphinx-of-wonder), [Sprite](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/4775845-sprite), or [Venomous Snake](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/4775847-venomous-snake).
	  Additionally, when you take the [Attack](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#AttackAction) action, you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your familiar to make one attack of its own with its Reaction.
	- **Pact of the Tome**.
	  Stitching together strands of shadow, you conjure forth a book in your hand at the end of a Short or Long Rest. This _Book of Shadows_ (you determine its appearance) contains eldritch magic that only you can access, granting you the benefits below. The book disappears if you conjure another book with this feature or if you die.

**_Cantrips and Rituals._** When the book appears, choose three cantrips, and choose two level 1 spells that have the Ritual tag. The spells can be from any class’s spell list, and they must be spells you don’t already have prepared. While the book is on your person, you have the chosen spells prepared, and they function as Warlock spells for you.

**_Spellcasting Focus._** You can use the book as a Spellcasting Focus.
    
    

### Equipment

- **Warding Sigils.**
	- This armor has five charges. Each dawn, you may perform a ten minute ritual to regain charges equal to 1d4 + your wisdom modifier, up to a maximum of 5, as you prepare arcane sigils bolster your defenses against dark magic. These charges can be used in the following ways:
    When forced to make a saving throw against a spell, use your reaction to gain advantage on the saving throw (1 charge).
    When a spell attack targets you, use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll (1 charge)
    Cast [[Dispel Magic]] , at 3rd level (2 charges).
- **Dreadful Resolve.**
	- If your hit points are reduced to fewer than half your Hit Point maximum, you gain immunity to the frightened condition.

### Feats

- **Inspiring Leader**
	- At the end of a Short Rest or a Long Rest, you can give an inspiring performance: a speech, a song, or a dance. When you do so, choose up to six friendly creatures (which can include yourself) within 30 feet of you who witness the performance. The chosen creatures each gain Temporary Hit Points equal to 2d4 + your Proficiency Bonus.
    

### Racial

- **Breath Weapon.**
	- When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace one of your attacks with an exhalation of magical energy in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus). On a failed save, the creature takes 1d10 damage of the type associated with your Metallic Ancestry. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage. This damage increases by 1d10 when you reach 5th level (2d10), 11th level (3d10), and 17th level (4d10).
    You can use your Breath Weapon a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
- **Draconic Resistance.**
    - You have resistance to fire damage
    
- **Forceful Presence**
    - When you make a Intimidation or Persuasion check, you can do so with advantage once per long rest.
    
- **~~Metallic Breath Weapon.~~ (unlock at lv 5)**    
    - At 5th level, you gain a second breath weapon. When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace one of your attacks with an exhalation in a 15-foot cone. The save DC for this breath is 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. Whenever you use this trait, choose one:
        - **Enervating Breath.** Each creature in the cone must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become incapacitated until the start of your next turn.
        - **Repulsion Breath.** Each creature in the cone must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 20 feet away from you and be knocked prone.
        - Once you use your Metallic Breath Weapon, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.
