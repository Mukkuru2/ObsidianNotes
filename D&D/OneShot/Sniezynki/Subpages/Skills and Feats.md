### Class

- **Eldritch Invocations**
	- **Agonizing Blast: Chill Touch**
		- Choose one of your known Warlock cantrips that deals damage. You can add your Charisma modifier to that spell’s damage rolls.
	- **Pact of the Blade**
		- As a Bonus Action, you can conjure a pact weapon in your hand—a Simple or Martial Melee weapon of your choice with which you bond—or create a bond with a magic weapon you touch; you can’t bond with a magic weapon if someone else is attuned to it or another Warlock is bonded with it. Until the bond ends, you have proficiency with the weapon, and you can use it as a Spellcasting Focus.
		  Whenever you attack with the bonded weapon, you can use your Charisma modifier for the attack and damage rolls instead of using Strength or Dexterity; and you can cause the weapon to deal Necrotic, Psychic, or Radiant damage or its normal damage type.
		  Your bond with the weapon ends if you use this feature’s Bonus Action again, if the weapon is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more, or if you die. A conjured weapon disappears when the bond ends.
	-  **Fiendish Vigor**
		- You can cast [False Life](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618866-false-life) on yourself without expending a spell slot. When you cast the spell with this feature, you don’t roll the die for the [Temporary Hit Points](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#TemporaryHitPoints); you automatically get the highest number on the die.
	- **Eldritch Smite**
		- Once per turn when you hit a creature with your pact weapon, you can expend a Pact Magic spell slot to deal an extra 1d8 Force damage to the target, plus another 1d8 per level of the spell slot, and you can give the target the [Prone](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ProneCondition) condition if it is Huge or smaller.
	- **Thirsting Blade**
		- You gain the Extra Attack feature for your pact weapon only. With that feature, you can attack twice with the weapon instead of once when you take the [Attack](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#AttackAction) action on your turn.

- **Level 2: Magical Cunning**
	- You can perform an esoteric rite for 1 minute. At the end of it, you regain expended Pact Magic spell slots but no more than a number equal to half your maximum (round up). Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest.

- **Form of Dread**
	- At 1st level, you manifest an aspect of your patron’s dreadful power. As a bonus action, you transform for 1 minute. You gain the following benefits while transformed:
		- You gain temporary hit points equal to 1d10 + your warlock level.
		- Once during each of your turns, when you hit a creature with an attack, you can force it to make a Wisdom saving throw, and if the saving throw fails, the target is frightened of you until the end of your next turn.
		- You are immune to the frightened condition.
	- You can transform a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
	- The appearance of your Form of Dread reflects some aspect of your patron. For example, your form could be a shroud of shadows forming the crown and robes of your lich patron, or your body might glow with glyphs from ancient funerary rites and be surrounded by desert winds, suggesting your mummy patron.

- **Grave Touched**
	- At 6th level, your patron’s powers have a profound effect on your body and magic. You don’t need to eat, drink, or breathe.
	  In addition, once during each of your turns, when you hit a creature with an attack and roll damage against the creature, you can replace the damage type with necrotic damage. While you are using your Form of Dread, you can roll one additional damage die when determining the necrotic damage the target takes.

### Feats

- **Lucky**
	- You can reroll one d20 or force to reroll an attack roll against you (3/long rest).
- **Elemental Adept: Ice**
	- When you gain this feat, choose one of the following damage types: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder.  
	  Spells you cast ignore resistance to damage of the chosen type. In addition, when you roll damage for a spell you cast that deals damage of that type, you can treat any 1 on a damage die as a 2.  
	  You can select this feat multiple times. Each time you do so, you must choose a different damage type.
    

### Racial

- **Darkvision** 
	- You have Darkvision with a range of 60 feet.

- **Fiendish Legacy** 
	- You are the recipient of a fiendish legacy that grants you supernatural abilities. Choose a legacy from the Fiendish Legacies table: Abyssal, associated with Chaotic Evil planes; Chthonic, associated with Neutral Evil planes; or Infernal, associated with Lawful Evil planes. You gain the 1st-level benefit of the chosen legacy.
	  Starting at 3rd level and again at 5th level, you gain the ability to cast a higher-level Spell with this trait, as shown on the table. Once you cast the Spell with this trait, you can’t cast that Spell with it again until you finish a Long Rest*; however, you can cast the Spell using any Spell Slots you have of the appropriate level.
	  Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for the Spells you cast with this trait (choose the ability when you select the lineage).
