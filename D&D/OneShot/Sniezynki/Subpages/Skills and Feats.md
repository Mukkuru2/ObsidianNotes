### Class

- **Fighting Style: Dueling**
	- When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.
    
- **Second Wind**
	- You have a limited well of stamina that you can draw on to protect yourself from harm. On your turn, you can use a bonus action to regain hit points equal to 1d10 + your fighter level.
	Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.
    
- **Action Surge**
	- Starting at 2nd level, you can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment. On your turn, you can take one additional action.
	Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. Starting at 17th level, you can use it twice before a rest, but only once on the same turn.
    
- **Weapon Bond**
	- At 3rd level, you learn a ritual that creates a magical bond between yourself and one weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. The weapon must be within your reach throughout the ritual, at the conclusion of which you touch the weapon and forge the bond.
    Once you have bonded a weapon to yourself, you can't be disarmed of that weapon unless you are incapacitated. If it is on the same plane of existence, you can summon that weapon as a bonus action on your turn, causing it to teleport instantly to your hand.
    You can have up to two bonded weapons, but can summon only one at a time with your bonus action. If you attempt to bond with a third weapon, you must break the bond with one of the other two.
    

### Equipment

- **Warding Sigils.**
	- This armor has five charges. Each dawn, you may perform a ten minute ritual to regain charges equal to 1d4 + your wisdom modifier, up to a maximum of 5, as you prepare arcane sigils bolster your defenses against dark magic. These charges can be used in the following ways:
    When forced to make a saving throw against a spell, use your reaction to gain advantage on the saving throw (1 charge).
    When a spell attack targets you, use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll (1 charge)
    Cast [[Dispel Magic]] , at 3rd level (2 charges).
- **Dreadful Resolve.**
	- If your hit points are reduced to fewer than half your Hit Point maximum, you gain immunity to the frightened condition.

### Feats

- **Inspiring Leader**
	- At the end of a Short Rest or a Long Rest, you can give an inspiring performance: a speech, a song, or a dance. When you do so, choose up to six friendly creatures (which can include yourself) within 30 feet of you who witness the performance. The chosen creatures each gain Temporary Hit Points equal to 2d4 + your Proficiency Bonus.
    

### Racial

- **Breath Weapon.**
	- When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace one of your attacks with an exhalation of magical energy in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus). On a failed save, the creature takes 1d10 damage of the type associated with your Metallic Ancestry. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage. This damage increases by 1d10 when you reach 5th level (2d10), 11th level (3d10), and 17th level (4d10).
    You can use your Breath Weapon a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
- **Draconic Resistance.**
    - You have resistance to fire damage
    
- **Forceful Presence**
    - When you make a Intimidation or Persuasion check, you can do so with advantage once per long rest.
    
- **~~Metallic Breath Weapon.~~ (unlock at lv 5)**    
    - At 5th level, you gain a second breath weapon. When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace one of your attacks with an exhalation in a 15-foot cone. The save DC for this breath is 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. Whenever you use this trait, choose one:
        - **Enervating Breath.** Each creature in the cone must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become incapacitated until the start of your next turn.
        - **Repulsion Breath.** Each creature in the cone must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 20 feet away from you and be knocked prone.
        - Once you use your Metallic Breath Weapon, you canâ€™t do so again until you finish a long rest.
