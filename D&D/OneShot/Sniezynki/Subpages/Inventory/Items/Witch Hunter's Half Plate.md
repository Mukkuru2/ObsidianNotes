A suit of half-plate worn by those who dedicate their lives to hunting and destroying practitioners of the dark-arts - a grim and inherently dangerous line of work.

- **Warding Sigils.**
	- This armor has five charges. Each dawn, you may perform a ten minute ritual to regain charges equal to 1d4 + your wisdom modifier, up to a maximum of 5, as you prepare arcane sigils bolster your defenses against dark magic. These charges can be used in the following ways:
	- When forced to make a saving throw against a spell, use your reaction to gain advantage on the saving throw (1 charge).
	- When a spell attack targets you, use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll (1 charge)
	- Cast [Dispel Magic](https://www.notion.so/Dispel-Magic-8b68f8bff3444dbe92a69ac338f44966?pvs=21) , at 3rd level (2 charges).
- **Dreadful Resolve.**
	- If your hit points are reduced to fewer than half your Hit Point maximum, you gain immunity to the frightened condition.
